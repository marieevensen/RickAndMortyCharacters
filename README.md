# RickAndMortyCharacters


In this project I learned about using API, and retrieve data from this external source.
I have used a Rick and Morty API, so everytime you refresh the site, it chooses a new random Rick and Morty character.
If you only want one character, you can write the ID of the character in the end of the API.

The project gives you:
- A picture of the character
- Name
- Status
- Species
- Gender
- Type
- Last known location
- Origin

This project is very useful if you want to retrieve data from an API.
